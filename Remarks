* I fixed the DOM Tree, and remove the filter for now since I don't have anything to filter on, just the gender and if the product is a new arrival or not. Later maybe I will work on the filter if there are any other categories that I can use.
* I tried to use /shop/<any extension here> but I still redirect to the Shop component. I don't know if it is a good design so I will not put any router / anchors for the {category} for now.


* Fixed the cards border, Tailwind style
