* I fixed the DOM Tree, and remove the filter for now since I don't have anything to filter on, just the gender and if the product is a new arrival or not. Later maybe I will work on the filter if there are any other categories that I can use.
* I tried to use /shop/<any extension here> but I still redirect to the Shop component. I don't know if it is a good design so I will not put any router / anchors for the {category} for now.
* Fixed the cards border, Tailwind style
* Also fixed the React Router, instead of passing props to <Outlet />, I used the useParams. useParams is very slick!
* I accessed the id of the cards using 'closest', instead of what I always do (e.target.parentNode.parentNode.....id)
* Now I got a page for the shop navigation, after lots of struggles debugging. <Found out that the bug is in React Routing, regarding the naming using colon, it should not be adjacent to another link>
* Fixed the retrieving of information on navigation page (another mapping and filtering)
* Got bugged on the image size, cropped and unusual stretching all because of align-items: stretch which is by default.

* Updated the JSON file and added shoe sizes prop
* designed the shop navigation page, with the images and sizes (only needs the price and the add to cart button, and some css)

2. use the data to grey out other sizes that are false âœ…
